üìñ Project Overview

The goal of this project is to classify images as either with a mask or without a mask using deep learning techniques. This is a crucial application in public health monitoring systems, especially during pandemics.

The system leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for feature extraction and classification, ensuring high accuracy and robust performance.
üíª Technologies Used

    Python 3.12
    Libraries and Frameworks:
        TensorFlow/Keras
        OpenCV
        NumPy
        Matplotlib
        Scikit-learn
    Hardware: GPU (for faster training)

üìÇ Dataset

The dataset contains images of individuals with and without face masks. It includes:

    Labeled data for supervised learning.
    Variations in lighting, angles, and environments to improve model robustness.

Dataset Sources:

    Kaggle Face Mask Dataset or other publicly available repositories.

üß† Deep Learning Approach
1. Data Preprocessing

    Image Resizing: All images resized to 128x128 pixels.
    Normalization: Pixel values scaled to [0, 1].
    Data Augmentation: Techniques like rotation, flipping, zooming, and brightness adjustments were applied to increase data diversity.

2. Model Architecture

We designed a custom CNN and also leveraged transfer learning with pre-trained models like MobileNetV2 for feature extraction.
Custom CNN Architecture:

    Convolutional Layers: For feature extraction.
    Pooling Layers: To reduce dimensionality.
    Dropout Layers: To prevent overfitting.
    Dense Layers: For classification.

Transfer Learning with MobileNetV2:

    Pre-trained on ImageNet.
    Fine-tuned the final layers for binary classification (Mask/No Mask).

3. Model Training

    Loss Function: Binary Crossentropy
    Optimizer: Adam
    Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
